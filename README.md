The dashboard highlights KPI metrics, demographic performance, campaign efficiency, and audience insights, enabling data-driven decision-making for ad spend optimization.

Bar/Column Charts: Conversions by Age, Gender, Campaign

Pie/Donut Charts: Conversion share by Gender, Spend share by Age

Scatter Plot: CPC vs Conversions (efficiency analysis)

Filters (Slicers): Age range, Gender, Campaign ID

ðŸ”‘ Key Insights

Most Conversions: Driven by 25â€“34 age group, followed by 18â€“24.

Best Converting Gender: Female audiences showed slightly higher conversion rates.

Campaign ROI: A few campaigns performed well with positive ROI, while others had negative ROI, highlighting optimization opportunities.

Efficiency: Some ads had low CPC but high conversions, making them ideal candidates for scaling.
